## Project Description:
This project focuses on building an object detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. The goal is to accurately classify images into specific classes or detect the presence of a particular object within the images.

### The project follows a sequential model design and incorporates the following key components and steps:

1- Dataset Preparation: A labeled dataset is prepared, consisting of images categorized into different classes or containing specific objects of interest. The dataset should have corresponding annotations or labels indicating the presence or absence of the objects within the images.

2- CNN Model Architecture: The CNN model is designed using the Sequential API, a linear stack of layers. The model starts with a convolutional layer with 32 filters, each of size 3x3. The 'same' padding ensures that the spatial dimensions of the input are preserved, while the ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity.

3- Additional Convolutional Layer: Another convolutional layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 filter size is added, followed by ReLU activation. This helps the model to extract more complex and high-level features from the images.

4- Max Pooling Layer: A max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2 is included to downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This reduces the computational complexity while retaining important features.

5- Dropout Regularization: Dropout is applied to the model with a rate of 0.5. It randomly drops out 50% of the connections during training, preventing overfitting by reducing the model's reliance on specific features.

6- Flattening and Dense Layers: The feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers are flattened into a 1-dimensional vector. This vector is then fed into two fully connected dense layers. The first dense layer consists of 128 units with ReLU activation, allowing the model to learn complex relationships between the features. The second dense layer has a single unit with a sigmoid activation function, producing a binary classification output.

7- Model Compilation: The model is compiled using the binary cross-entropy loss function, which is suitable for binary classification problems. The Adam optimizer is used to update the model's weights during training. The accuracy metric is chosen to evaluate the model's performance.

By implementing this object detection project using CNN, the model can accurately classify images and detect the presence of specific objects within them. This technology finds applications in various domains such as computer vision, autonomous systems, surveillance, and object recognition tasks. The project enables efficient and automated image classification, enabling developers to build advanced applications that require object detection capabilities.
